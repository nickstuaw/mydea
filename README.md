# mydea
A basic thought-catching program

# Idea storage
Ideas are stored in a .txt file in the working directory. There is no fixed location.

## Add bash command (mydea example)
This assumes py_idea.py has been placed in /usr/bin.
Run `alias mydea="/usr/bin/py_idea.py"`

### If you don't use Linux
If you have python, you can just run the python script in the command line by using `python3 py_idea.py` or `python py_idea.py`
